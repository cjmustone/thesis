The project overall is designed to monitor and detect deauth attacks aimed at your home network. Once a 
deauthentication attack is detected it will send a notification to the synced Android application with 
details of the attack.

A user will create an account on the Android application followed by a prompt to plug the mobile device into the RaspberryPi. This will
transfer necessary data that will link the RaspberryPi to that user. Once that is complete, the user runs the application in the background
and waits for a push notification upon detection of a deauthentication attack on their home network.


Secondary programs needed to run Raspberry Pi components:
 - aircrack-ng
 - tcpdump
 - inotify-tools
